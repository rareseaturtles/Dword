            <h2>Understanding Step 2</h2>
            <p><strong>Step 2 of Alcoholics Anonymous states:</strong></p>
            <blockquote>
                "Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity."
            </blockquote>
            <p>This step encourages individuals to acknowledge the need for assistance beyond their own willpower to overcome addiction. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing a higher power that can aid in the recovery process.</p>
            <h3>Key Aspects of Step 2:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Acknowledgment of a Higher Power:</strong> Recognizing the existence of a force greater than oneself, which can be interpreted in various ways, including God, nature, or the collective strength of the AA community.</li>
                <li><strong>Restoration to Sanity:</strong> Understanding that addiction has led to unmanageable situations, and seeking help is essential for regaining control and achieving sobriety.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Practical Steps to Embrace Step 2:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Attend AA Meetings Regularly:</strong> Participating in meetings provides support and a sense of community, reinforcing the belief in a higher power.</li>
                <li><strong>Engage in Self-Reflection:</strong> Contemplate how addiction has affected your life and consider the possibility of a higher power aiding in recovery.</li>
